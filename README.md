### Dice Game Description

This Python project is a simple dice game for 2 to 4 players. The goal is to be the first to reach a score of 50 points.

**Gameplay:**
1. **Setup**: Players input the number of participants (2-4). Each player's score starts at zero.
2. **Turns**: Players take turns rolling a die. Rolling a 1 ends the turn with no points added; rolling 2-6 adds the number to the turn's score. Players can choose to roll again or hold.
3. **Scoring**: At the end of a turn, the turn's score is added to the player's total score.
4. **Winning**: The first player to reach 50 points wins.

This project demonstrates basic game mechanics, user input handling, and random number generation.
